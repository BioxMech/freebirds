# Setting up
## Frontend
Open up your command prompt and direct into the üìÅclient folder and type the following:

#### <i>To install packages locally (or 1st time opening the application locally):</i>
``` npm install ```

#### To launch the Frontend locally
``` npm start ```

## Backend
Setting up backend requires a file called "config.js" in the root folder. 
<br />
Follow the code layout shown below:
```
module.exports = {
  MONGODB: MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING_URI
  SECRET_KEY: CREATE_YOUR_OWN_SECRET_KEY
} 
```

Once the file is created, install the packages locally (especially if you are setting it up the 1st time)
Similarly to the frontend set up, open up your command prompt and direct into the root folder of the project and follow the instructions below:
#### <i>To install packages locally (or 1st time opening the application locally):</i>
``` npm install ```

#### To launch the Backend locally
``` npm run start ```
